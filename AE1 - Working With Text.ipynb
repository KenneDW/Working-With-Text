    "In hindsight, one of the largest issues that came about in working on this application was that of the input size of the data. Having spent most previous experience in Data Science working on much smaller amounts of data, moving up to something larger (which is still likely much smaller than what you'd be expected to work on in the workforce) presented an issue as far as effciency. Any task that required iterating over the entire dataset would need to be as efficient as possible, to prevent a massive time delay between input and result. I believe that this was mostly solved in the application, as the bulk of longer code-return times occur before user input can be utilized (As in, most long waittimes on code compiling occurred during pre-processing, which would occur before the user would be able to access the data). Still, this meant more efficient code had to be produced during pre-processing to make the overall compilation as fast as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue that was encountered during the project was the best means of containing large and diverse sets of data together. For instance, word frequencies were grouped either as dictionaries, or Counter objects. However, it would be cumbersome to return a dozen separate objects from one function, so the decision was made instead to fit dictionaries and objects inside of dataframes. This was additionally justified as the dataframe was going to be the end destination of the data, so it wouldn't be as important for the dataframe to be easily manipulatable as it could've been if a different method was used. \n",
    "\n",
    "In future iterations, it would likely be better to break the functions into even smaller chunks, and designate a system to keep track of every separate dataset. This would be so that the overall code could be more efficient, and that unneeded code wouldn't be run side-by-side with code of pertinence. That would be more beneficial as the input size grows larger, and the code entirely needs to become more efficient.\n"
